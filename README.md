## üîÑ Versioning and Cache Busting

This app uses a browser-based version check (`__APP_VERSION__`) to detect new deployments and force a reload of cached assets.

> ‚ö†Ô∏è **Important:** You must manually update the `version` field in `package.json` before each deploy to ensure clients receive the latest version.

```bash
npm version patch
```

This ensures users always receive the latest version without needing to clear their browser cache.
